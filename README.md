# Unit 20 React Homework: React Portfolio
I created my updated portfolio using React.js that features 2 projects and 4 assignments using various technologies such as JS, Mongoose, MongoDB, Node.js, Express,Heroku, Handlebars, HTML, CSS, Cloudinary and React.js.

Implementation of react router to link through pages via the nav bar.  Dynamic rendering of images and stylings to duplicate the original portfolio.
Now that you've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, you'll be updating your portfolio and other materials to build toward being employer competitive. Creating a portfolio using React will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.
